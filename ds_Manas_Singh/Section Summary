Crypto Trader Performance & Sentiment Analysis
1. Methodology
This project investigates the correlation between market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) and trader activity to forecast next-day profitability.
Data Integration: Historical trade data (over 10,000) was combined with daily Fear & Greed Index data, ensuring precise time-series alignment to prevent look-ahead bias.
Feature Engineering:
- Data Sanitization: Leverage was limited to 125x to reduce the effect of outliers, and missing margin data was imputed.
- Sentiment Encoding: One-Hot Encoding was used to encode sentiment labels to consider market states as separate categories instead of ordinal values.
- Target Variable: A Next_Day_PnL binary target variable was defined to forecast future performance based on current activity.
- Modeling: A Random Forest Classifier was used with Time-Series Walk-Forward Validation. This approach simulates actual trading scenarios by training on past data and testing on future data, preventing data leakage.

2. Key Insights
- The “Fear Profitability” Paradox: Contrary to the Fear state having lower trading volume, it registered the highest total profitability ($3.35M) and average trade amount ($7,816). This suggests the presence of a contrarian trader community making high-confidence trades during periods of market fear.
- Retail FOMO in Greed Cycles: Days with Extreme Greed sentiment showed a 500% relative increase in trade volume compared to days with a Neutral sentiment, but a dramatic drop in profitability per trade. This points to the entry of poor-quality, noisy trading activity fueled by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO).
- Leverage vs. Success: High leverage (>50x) was a lagging indicator of market tops. Successful traders, called “Whales,” kept lower leverage (<5x) while significantly increasing position sizes in volatile markets.
- Predictive Power: The model had an accuracy of 60.2% with a precision of 0.60 on correctly predicting winning days. The results of the feature importance test showed that Position Size and Sentiment Score were better predictors of success than Leverage.

3. Strategy Recommendations
Based on the results, the following strategies can be recommended to Primetrade.ai:
- Dynamic Risk Governor: Automate risk management to lower the maximum allowable retail leverage when the Long/Short Ratio exceeds 2.0 in Extreme Greed phases, thus protecting traders from predictable mean reversion.
- “Smart Money” Copy Trading: Create a list of traders who have demonstrated positive PnL in Fear phases. These contrarian traders have a higher statistical probability of survival compared to those who trade profitably in a bull market.
- Volatility-Adjusted Alerts: Employ
